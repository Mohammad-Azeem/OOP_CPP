  <li>Short quizzes on the practices (plus-minus system), grading: passed/not passed, and half of the short quizzes should be passed</li>
  <li> 3 Assignments (documentation, code, and unit testing), grading: 0-5,all of them has to be defended each week dealy will reduce the grade by one,The third assignment is code-based assignment and its grade is reduced by every day  </li>
